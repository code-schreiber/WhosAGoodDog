This project provides an demo app that interacts with the [dog.ceo API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/).

- A main view with 2 tabs: Home and MyDog
- On the MyDog tab a random dog image and it's breed's name will be shown, to show another image use the "That's not my dog!" button
  
###### Technical details and used technologies
